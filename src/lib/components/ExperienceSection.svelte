			Following my time at Alliance High School, I enrolled at Kenyatta University to pursue a
			<b>Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication and Information Technology</b>. It was during this
			phase that I discovered my passion for programming and began exploring web technologies in
			depth. Currently, I’m on industrial attachment at <b>DrugIndex.it</b>, where I contribute to
			the development and maintenance of the DrugIndex web application—an innovative platform
			focused on organizing and delivering pharmaceutical data efficiently. This hands-on experience
			has sharpened my technical skills and strengthened my commitment to building impactful digital
			solutions.

			grade, a reflection of consistent effort, growth, and resilience throughout my secondary
			education.
